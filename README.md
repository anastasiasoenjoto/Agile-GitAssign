The app mentioned in the article which carries Trojan Dropper module is CamScanner. I use it a lot, but on Apple devices. It makes me think about how different operating systems deal with viruses and malware. Why some seem to be more vulnerable than others. It is also interesting to know how large companies like Google manage security issues on their platform.

I think it's really cool that Google would pay people who can find vulnerabilities and bugs in apps. It's nice to see that they care about the integrity of Play Store apps and the safety and privacy of users.

I think its interesting to see what actions a large company such as Google are taking to ensure the privacy of their users amongst other possible bugs. I think this rewards program will allow more bugs to be detected that could potentially be harmful for the users.
